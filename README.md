<h2>Real time Edge Detection using Laplacian and Canny Method</h2>

<b>Canny Edge Detection Method</b>

The objective of the program given is to perform edge detection of videos in real-time.<br><br>

The popular canny edge detection algorithm 
is used to detect a wide range of edges in images.<br> OpenCV has in-built function cv2.Canny() 
which takes our input image as first argument and Threshold values(min and max)
as last two arguments.

<b>Laplacian Edge Detection method</b> <br><br>



The Laplacian edge detector uses only one kernel.
It calculates second order derivatives in a single pass.
